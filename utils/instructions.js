  The object of the game is to not execute the hangman.
  Solve the word and the hangman lives.
  Run out of guesses and there is blood on your fingers.

  Your score is calculated by how many guesses it takes to solve the word.
  The less guesses it takes, the higher your score!
  If you are responsible for an execution, you will lose 5 points.
  
  Your score is checked against the current high score after every trial.
  Every new trial is risky, as there is a chance you may cause an execution.
  Proceed with caution.

  GOOD LUCK!

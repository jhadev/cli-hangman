  The object of the game is to not execute the hangman.
  Solve the word and the hangman lives.
  Run out of guesses and there is blood on your fingers.

  Your score is calculated by how many guesses it takes to solve the word.
  If you are responsible for an execution, you will lose 2 points.
  The less guesses it takes, the higher your score!

  GOOD LUCK!
